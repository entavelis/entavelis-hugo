abstract: "Recent advances in Computer Vision and Deep Learning have enabled
  astonishing results in a variety of fields and applications. Motivated by this
  success, the SkyCam Dataset aims to enable image-based Deep Learning solutions
  for short-term, precise prediction of solar radiation on a local level. For
  the span of a year, three different cameras in three topographically different
  locations in Switzerland are acquiring images of the sky every 10 seconds.
  Thirteen high resolution images with different exposure times are captured and
  used to create an additional HDR image. The images are paired with highly
  precise irradiance values gathered from a high-accuracy pyranometer. "
