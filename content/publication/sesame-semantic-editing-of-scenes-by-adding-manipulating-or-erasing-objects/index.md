abstract: "Recent advances in image generation gave rise to powerful tools for
  semantic image editing. However, existing approaches can either operate on a
  single image or require an abundance of additional information. They are not
  capable of handling the complete set of editing operations, that is addition,
  manipulation or removal of semantic concepts. To address these limitations, we
  propose SESAME, a novel generator-discriminator pair for Semantic Editing of
  Scenes by Adding, Manipulating or Erasing objects. In our setup, the user
  provides the semantic labels of the areas to be edited and the generator
  synthesizes the corresponding pixels. In contrast to previous methods that
  employ a discriminator that trivially concatenates semantics and image as an
  input, the SESAME discriminator is composed of two input streams that
  independently process the image and its semantics, using the latter to
  manipulate the results of the former. We evaluate our model on a diverse set
  of datasets and report state-of-the-art performance on two tasks: (a) image
  manipulation and (b) image generation conditioned on semantic labels. "
