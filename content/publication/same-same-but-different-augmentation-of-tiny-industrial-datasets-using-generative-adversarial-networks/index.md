abstract: The evolution of generative adversarial networks has permitted the
  generation of realistic fake images which, in some cases, are
  indistinguishable from the real ones. Many recent works in image generation
  focus on learning internal image statistics via training only on a single
  natural image. While natural images exhibit a variability in their attributes,
  industrial images are often acquired in a controlled environment following a
  specific structure. In this work we utilize the cutting-edge results of single
  image generation on the structured case of industrial images. Deep Learning
  plays an important role in Industry 4.0 manufacturing lines and multiple
  ML-based image processing products are currently on the market. To be able to
  tackle a variety of problems where image acquisition is costly and
  time-consuming data generation is a promising approach. The proposed method
  only requires a handful of images for training, making it an ideal candidate
  for industrial application where data is scarce and confidential. It provides
  the foundation for a variety of use cases in the field of industrial Deep
  Learning.
