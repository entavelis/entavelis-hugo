abstract: "Positional encodings have enabled recent works to train a single
  adversarial network that can generate images of different scales. However,
  these approaches are either limited to a set of discrete scales or struggle to
  maintain good perceptual quality at the scales for which the model is not
  trained explicitly. We propose the design of scale-consistent positional
  encodings invariant to our generator's layers transformations. This enables
  the generation of arbitrary-scale images even at scales unseen during
  training. Moreover, we incorporate novel inter-scale augmentations into our
  pipeline and partial generation training to facilitate the synthesis of
  consistent images at arbitrary scales. Lastly, we show competitive results for
  a continuum of scales on various commonly used datasets for image synthesis. "
