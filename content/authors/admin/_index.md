I am a PhD Student at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch) of [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) and [CSEM](https://csem.ch) under the supervision of Prof. Luc Van Gool. I am also advised by [Dr. Martin Danelljan](https://martin-danelljan.github.io/) and [Prof. Radu Timofte](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~timofter/). I have an advanced master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from KULeuven, Belgium, and an Electrical and Computer Engineering diploma from the National Technical University of Athens

These days I occupy myself with tasks revolving around generating and manipulating images. I am particularly interested in finding out how we can control this process while retaining high perceptual quality.
